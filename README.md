# mortar-notes

These are some notes on how to synthesize and repair networks where an attacker is able to convince some number of nodes to route to it.
Our goal is to try and synthesize filters or some other form of defensive mechanism to protect those nodes from the attacker and make the
network more secure.

Notes are listed in YYYY-MM-DD.md title format.
