# September 19

- Focus on a BGP-like model as in the paper, not necessarily a complete model of BGP
- NV's lack of support for sequences makes representing paths and trees difficult and non-scalable: consider switching to a C program based implementation as in the LPAR15 paper
- Focus on **valid paths and trees**, and **safe nodes**
- Focus on **proactive defense** and **self-repair**: *TODO*, find papers in this area
- How can you synthesize filters or strategize to combat attacks?
- Consider *replayability*: we use an abstract model and return a concrete counterexample -- how concrete does it need to be to let us simulate it?
- Consider a (pseudo-)concrete model for the simulator (e.g. `gdb`), written in C without abstractions
- For model checking, we can use an abstract model which abstracts over the safe nodes
- Consider black-box runs of a real network implementation compared to a spec; if the runs are detailed enough, we could plug them into mininet/some other network simulation tool
- Consider conformance testing: e.g. Cisco's OSPF implementation vs. the OSPF standard
- Identifying suspicious messages: test a message in some (local) ways to see if it's legitimiate
- Problem scope: there is some *administrator* outside the system, who can change the AS they control but not others
- We're limited in terms of what we can change: what preferences can we manipulate to improve defense (a) at a node? (b) in the whole network?
- Anything statically checked is *safe*: we want to focus on parts of the
 network that need model checking for safety
 - An owner may control multiple ASes: opportunity to modularize at this boundary instead of at AS level: controller scope
 - Consider making changes to the config at the ownership level
