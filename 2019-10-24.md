- [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mJ_99DILVmSaX1wue1PxJA0JPrtPk0Lx9Qst4xd7xMA/edit?usp=sharing)
- Discussed prefix hijacking as a common attack in practice, countered using filtering and public key infrastructures (registry of IP addresses to ASes)
- Used model essentially as-is from LPAR15, but also want to consider:
  - (a) importance of security within routing decision (see [Lychev, Goldberg, Schapira. BGP Security in Partial Deployment. SIGCOMM13](https://www.cs.bu.edu/~goldbe/papers/partialSec.pdf))
  - (b) presence of a partial map at each AS to look up if an AS is authorized to advertise an IP address
- Discussed Fig 2 from Sosnovich LPAR15 paper, considered different kinds of filtering possible to handle attraction attack
- Noted relationship between safe nodes and "secured" announcements:
  - any AS that has the destination as a customer can know the address block as secure;
  - preferring to route through nodes that are known to be safe ensures safety;
  - to investigate: is there a difference between nodes that are safe syntactically versus via model checking?
- **To consider**: how many / which nodes need to filter/have security preferences to make the whole network safe? computing the closure
