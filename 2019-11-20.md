## From Tim

- [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fXK5ph4Z0vS9nEj1GUEh_jxevoYF2NeQS9_DP2uy4rA/edit?usp=sharing)
- Discussed RPKI API: sign and validate commands
- RPKI is potentially another attack vector if a false signature is added: RPKI hijacking
- *TODO*: look into possible attacks on RPKI
- Most ASes are stubs (only 1 provider): hence, even without RPKI can still validate customer paths (defensive filtering);
note that peers can't defensively filter
- Discussed similarities between doomed/immune/protectable ASes with trivially attracted/drc/other ASes
- **Question to consider:** can we generalize from one attacker/destination pair to multiple attacker/destination pairs?
- Consider which routers are the best targets for additional security for maximal benefit.
- Possible tradeoff: secure more routers to achieve better security; is there a tipping point where more security doesn't give a greater improvement?

## From Orna

- We discussed the option of looking at a set of fragments, each defined by its destination-attacker pair.
For each fragment to find a set of ASs that if secure can give us the best/a good security measure for the fragment.

- Then we discussed the possibility to now combine the fragments and generalize the sets of secure ASs, defined for each of them, so that they will provide security for a larger part of the Internet.
We left open the question of how to define our security goal. Smaller number of secure ASs? Other?

- An option is to use the metric \[Tim\] mentioned, defined in the paper by Goldberg, or a similar metric.
