- Discussed RPKI API: sign and validate commands
- RPKI is potentially another attack vector if a false signature is added: RPKI hijacking
- *TODO*: look into possible attacks on RPKI
- Most ASes are stubs (only 1 provider): hence, even without RPKI can still validate customer paths (defensive filtering);
note that peers can't defensively filter
- Discussed similarities between doomed/immune/protectable ASes with trivially attracted/drc/other ASes
- **Question to consider:** can we generalize from one attacker/destination pair to multiple attacker/destination pairs?
- Consider which routers are the best targets for additional security for maximal benefit.
- Possible tradeoff: secure more routers to achieve better security; is there a tipping point where more security doesn't give a greater improvement?
