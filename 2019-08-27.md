# August 27

* We want to look for attacks and vulnerabilities of BGP
* synthesize *defensive filters* on AS domain borders to reduce attacks
* examples of networks: CAIDA database
* BGP AS boundaries --> interfaces
* *repair/synthesis* to construct "wall" against an attacker
* What are safe nodes? What are unsafe nodes and what makes them unsafe?
* **Question 1**: Can you model Orna's BGP paper's BGP model in NV?
  - in particular, can you represent valid paths and valid trees?
  - take the smallest example in the paper, find out what features are needed
    in NV to reason over it
* expressing random/nondeterministic attacker behaviour
* model checking a BGP run represented in NV
  - all possible attacker behaviours: have to traverse each path
* could we need a symbolic execution engine? would unwind some number of actions (cf. bounded model checking)
* **Question 2**: What can we use to handle a model checking approach in NV?
* How is the simulator implemented in NV?
* **Question 3**: How would we represent all paths, instead of just a single simulation path?
* What kinds of partitions could this use / Is there a modularity argument?
