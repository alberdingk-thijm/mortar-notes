- Discussed adding a prefix list/RPKI to the model
  - *TODO*: Formalize form of RPKI queries in model
- Discussed role of security in routing preference
  - Look at  [Lychev, Goldberg, Schapira](https://www.cs.bu.edu/~goldbe/papers/partialSec.pdf) paper for discussion of this,
    esp. forms of simulation input given in paper
  - Consider taking ideas from the paper and applying them to model checking rather than simulation
  - Q: Can we provide a synthesis tool for suggesting security improvements to **prevent** attacks or secure the network?
- Look at distribution of traffic across Internet for ideas on which ASes are most useful to secure (Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.)
